# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 3rd year student working towards a degree in Computer Science at the University of Leeds. 

Currently, I am a Technical Project Manager intern at X-Lab Systems. I am also developing full stack projects & taking an active interest in data science & cybersecurity (networks, customer-facing apps).

This GitHub page serves as an observation point for my software engineering path & development. ðŸŒŸ
