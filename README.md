# Hey there 👋
I am a Computer Science with Year in Industry graduate always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and develop new skills. 

Currently, I am an Associate Engineer at X-Lab Systems working on the Labgnostic digital diagnostic exchange solution.

I am developing full stack projects & taking an active interest in distributed systems, Cloud infrastructure and machine learning.

My final year project in University was about building a modular and scalable benchmarking tool for various Blockchain networks and smart contract applications (i.e Ethereum, Stellar, Tron, RSK) and performing an analysis on the generated data.

This GitHub page serves as an observation point for my software engineering path and development. 🌟
